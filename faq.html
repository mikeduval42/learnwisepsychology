                <p class="text-dark-light mb-0">We do not currently accept insurance but are able to offer a superbill upon your request. We recommend contacting your insurance provider prior to services to determine if psychoeducational assessments may potentially be partially reimbursed following submission of a superbill. We make no guarantees and hold no liability for insurance outcomes.</p>

                <p class="text-dark-light mb-0 pb-3">Evaluation results will yield any applicable diagnoses and recommendations. These results will be shared in a comprehensive written report that will be reviewed in detail with the client. Disclosure of assessment results is at the discretion of the client with the exception of mandated reporting for safety purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-dark-light mb-0">Clients often consider sharing a copy of the written report with: the student's school team, service providers (mental health, speech and language, occupational therapist, etc), and physicians. Results can assist in advocating for access to educational supports and accommodations including Section 504 Plans, IEPs, and supports for individuals with disabilities in the college/vocational programs and the workplace according to ADA.</p>

                <p class="text-dark-light mb-0 pb-3">All clients seeking psychoeducational assessment should be informed that, if there is reason to suspect that a student has a disability that may require Special Education services, a Psychoeducational Assessment can be requested from the student's school district regardless of enrollment in public, private, or home-school instruction.</p>
                <p class="text-dark-light mb-0">When parents choose to seek private assessment prior to seeking supports from the school district, it is important to understand that districts have the right to conduct their own assessment in order to consider Special Education eligibility.</p>
